# NumberingSystemsWithConner
There is a long list of things to do in order to build this code properly.  The first thing to do is import our system in order to read our arguments we will have to send.  Next I printed the name of the code "Numbering Systems With Conner" and I also created a variable that contained the number of arguments a user sends when running the code.  After this I printed the number of arguments and started writing the if statement.  This statement will give us the second argument if there is one as well as finding the input, number, and hex of the argument.  We start the if statment by stating that if the amount of arguments are >= 2 then the 2nd argument will go through this process.  After the if statment I printed the argument as it was and created 3 variables.  The first stated the argument as a string, the second as an integer, and the third as a hex.  After this I printed all three of these variables.  After this we can copy this entire if stement and multiply it 5 times.  This will allow us to take up to five numbers as arguments.  Along with some changes to which arguments these if statements print as well as changing the >= 2 up by one for each of the if stementements then you will get the code that makes up "Numbering Systems With Conner.
